# Chip8

A Chip8 emulator written in Java. [What's Chip8?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) To make it short, it's an old programming language from the 70s, and it's a great project to understand the basics of emulation! Go check out [r/emudev](https://www.reddit.com/r/emudev) to meet a lot of other people talking about emulators development.
